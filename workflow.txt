Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
    radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
    texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
    perimeter
    area
    smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
    compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
    concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
    concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
    symmetry
    fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.
Missing attribute values: none
Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
