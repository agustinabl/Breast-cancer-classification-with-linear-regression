# Breast Cancer Classifier using Linear Regression model 🎀
In this project, we use a linear regression model to classify breast cancer into:

- **1** --> benign
- **0** --> malignant 

## Requirements 🛠️
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn

## Dataset 📊
The dataset was taken from:
Wolberg,William, Mangasarian,Olvi, Street,Nick, and Street,W.. (1995). Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic). UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5DW2B.

## Workflow 🚀
1. **Import Dependencies**
2. **Data Collection from CSV**
3. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
    - Separate feature and target variables
    - Data standardization
4. **Model Training using SVM**
5. **Model's Performance Evaluation**
    - Accuracy metric on both training and testing data
6. **Creation of Predictive System**
    - User input values to get the result 

## How to Use 📋

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/agustinabl/Breast-cancer-classification-with-linear-regression
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   - Move into the project directory:

     ```bash
     cd Breast-cancer-classification-with-linear-regression
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script in your terminal:

     ```bash
     python clean_bc.py
     ```

    Follow the prompts to input data. You can try using the values from [breastcancerdata.csv](https://github.com/agustinabl/Breast-cancer-classification-with-linear-regression/blob/main/breastcancerdata.csv?plain=1#L3), just copy and paste the numbers afer de letter.

   👀 Please note: to check if the model is right you can look at the same text note and see if the letter is:
     - m --> then te cancer is malign
     - b --> then the cancer is benign
